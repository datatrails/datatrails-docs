**Note:** This page is primarily intended for developers who will be writing applications that will use DataTrails for provenance. 
If you are looking for a simple way to test our API you might prefer our [Postman collection](https://www.postman.com/datatrails-inc/workspace/datatrails-public/overview), the [YAML runner](/developers/yaml-reference/story-runner-components/) or the [Developers](https://app.datatrails.ai) section of the web UI. 

Additional YAML examples can be found in the articles in the [Overview](/platform/overview/introduction/) section.
{{< /note >}}

The tenancies API is used to manage the configuration of your tenant. This is typically done from 
within the product, but its possible to retrieve and modify some configs programatically.
