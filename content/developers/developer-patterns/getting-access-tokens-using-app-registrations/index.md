Non-interactive access to the RKVST platform is managed by creating `Integrations` with either a Custom Integration or one of the built-in Integrations. This is done using either the `Settings` Menu in the RKVST UI or by using the App Registrations API directly.
{{< note >}}
**Note:** App Registration is the previous name for an Integration.
{{< /note >}}
 
`Integrations` have a `CLIENT_ID` and `SECRET` used to authenticate with RKVST IAM endpoints using [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/introduction/) (JWT).

RKVST authentication uses the industry-standard OIDC Client Credentials Flow.

## Creating a Custom Integration

{{< note >}}
**Note:** Creating App Registrations requires **Administrator** privileges.  
If `Settings` does not appear in the navigation, see your RKVST Administrator for access.
{{< /note >}}

### Using the RKVST App to Create an Integration (First-Time Setup)

1. As an Administrator, open the <a href="https://app.rkvst.io/" target="_blank">RKVST App</a>
1. Navigate to `Settings` on the sidebar
1. Navigate to the `Integrations` tab
  {{< img src="IntegrationsTab.png" alt="Rectangle" caption="<em>Navigate to Settings, then Integration</em>" class="border-0" >}}
1. Click the `Custom` box to create a Custom Integration
1. Enter any `Display Name` you'd like
  {{< img src="Confirm.png" alt="Rectangle" caption="<em>Completed Web Registration</em>" class="border-0" >}}
  {{< note >}}
  Optionally add any `Custom claims` at this step by clicking the `+ Add` button. Ensure the `Name` _does not start_ with `jit_` (RKVST reserved names) or use any other [well-known reserved claims](https://auth0.com/docs/security/tokens/json-web-tokens/json-web-token-claims#reserved-claims).
  {{< /note >}}  
1. Once complete, click `Confirm` to complete the custom integration
1. You will then be presented with the `CLIENT_ID` and `SECRET` required by the archivist token endpoint
{{< caution >}}
**Caution:** Save the `CLIENT_ID` and `SECRET` to a password manager or secret management service as the `SECRET` can **not** be viewed again. A new `SECRET` can be regenerated by editing the Integration, invalidating the previous `SECRET`.
{{< /caution >}}  
{{< img src="RecordClientIDandSecret.png" alt="Rectangle" caption="<em>Record your Client ID and Secret</em>" class="border-0" >}}
1. Copy the `CLIENT_ID` and `SECRET` to a password manager for future reference
1. Skip to [Grant Permissions to Custom Integration](#grant-permissions-to-custom-integration) to configure an Access Policy

### Using the App Registrations API to Create an Integration

{{< note >}}
**Note:** App Registration is the previous name for an Integration.
{{< /note >}}

The following assumes you have at least one `Custom Integration` with Administrator permissions and that you are comfortable generating tokens using the RKVST API.

If you do not yet have an Integration configured please follow the [first-time setup guide](./#using-the-rkvst-ui-to-create-an-app-registration-first-time-setup) to get started.

1. Define your new Integration JSON and save it to a file locally
    ```json
    {
        "display_name": "TrafficLight101",
        "custom_claims": {
          "serial_number": "TL1000000101",
          "has_cyclist_light": "true"
        }
    }
    ```
2. Submit your new Application JSON to the App Registration API endpoint
    ```bash
    curl -X POST \
        -H "@$BEARER_TOKEN_FILE" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d "@/path/to/jsonfile" \
        https://app.rkvst.io/archivist/iam/v1/applications
    ```
    Generates a response with details about the Integration's `CLIENT_ID` and `SECRET`:
    ```json
    {
        "identity": "applications/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
        "display_name": "TrafficLight101",
        "client_id": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
        "tenant_id": "tenant/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
        "credentials": [
            {
                "secret":"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
                "valid_from": "2021-09-21T16:43:19Z",
                "valid_until": "2022-09-21T16:43:19Z"
            }
        ],
        "custom_claims": {
            "serial_number": "TL1000000101",
            "has_cyclist_light": "true"
        }
    }
    ```
  {{< caution >}}
  **Caution:** You **must** take note of the `SECRET` at this point - it can **not** be viewed again later and you will have to generate a new one.
  {{< /caution >}}
1. You should now have a newly configured Integration and recorded its `CLIENT_ID` and `SECRET`. It can be used to [generate a token](./#getting-a-token-with-your-app-registration) and [access the RKVST API](./#testing-your-access).

For further details on using this API check out the [App Registrations API Reference](../../api-reference/app-registrations-api) which contains more detailed usage examples and has the full OpenAPI Reference.

### Grant Permissions to Custom Integration

Integrations are secured by default, with no permissions within RKVST. Create and assign an Access Policy to create and read RKVST information.

1. Navigate to `Access Policies` on the sidebar
  {{< img src="PolicyManage.png" alt="Rectangle" caption="<em>Access Policies</em>" class="border-0" >}}
1. Click `CREATE POLICY`, setting the `Name` and `Asset Types`=`*` for all types
  {{< note >}}
  Asset types can be filtered as needed. List existing `Asset Types` by typing at least two characters of a known type
  {{< /note >}}
  {{< img src="PolicyForm.png" alt="Rectangle" caption="<em>Create Access Policy Form</em>" class="border-0" >}}
1. Click `Permissions` to set a scope for the policy
1. Set Actors to the `USER_ID` of the Custom Integration
   - `User`
   - `Subject Identifier`
   - Paste the `CLIENT_ID` from the previous step
  {{< img src="PolicyPermissionActor.png" alt="Rectangle" caption="<em>Filter on User by Subject Identifier using the CLIENT_ID</em>" class="border-0" >}}
1. Set **Attribute Access** and **Event Visibility** to `All`
  {{< note >}}
  Each policy can be configured with multiple access rights
  {{< /note >}}
  {{< img src="PolicyPermissionAccess.png" alt="Rectangle" caption="<em>Set Attribute Access and Event Visibility</em>" class="border-0" >}}
1. Click the `ADD PERMISSION GROUP` for this policy
1. Click the `CREATE POLICY` to complete the creation of this policy

## Getting a Token With the Custom Integration

Having completed the steps at [Creating a Custom Integration](./#creating-a-custom-integration), and having taken note of the `CLIENT_ID` and the `SECRET`, a token can be obtained with the following command.

1. Save the `CLIENT_ID` and `SECRET` saved from above, to local variables
  {{< note >}}
   You can regenerate the secret, which will invalidate any previous usage
  {{< /note >}}
   ```bash
   CLIENT_ID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
   SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```
1. Generate a token using your pre-existing `Custom Integration` details, saving to a `RESPONSE` variable
    ```bash
    RESPONSE=$(curl https://app.rkvst.io/archivist/iam/v1/appidp/token \
                --data-urlencode "grant_type=client_credentials" \
                --data-urlencode "client_id=${CLIENT_ID}" \
                --data-urlencode "client_secret=${SECRET}")
    echo $RESPONSE
    ```
2. Save the base64 encoded `JWT` using `jq` to find `.access_token` (See [./jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) for more info)  
    ```bash
    TOKEN=$(echo -n $RESPONSE | jq -r .access_token)
    echo $TOKEN
    ```
3. Create a Bearer Token file with `0600` permissions for reference by `curl` commands
    ```bash
    echo Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN > rkvst-bearer.txt
    cat rkvst-bearer.txt
    ```

## Testing Token Creation

You can test access to the RKVST API using any of the standard API calls. GETing `Assets` is a simple test.

If successful, you will see a list of the assets the Integration has access to in the tenancy.
{{< note >}}
Note this may be an empty response if no assets are being shared with the user; this is an expected secure by default behavior.
{{< /note >}}

Otherwise, check the [Assets OpenAPI Reference](../../api-reference/assets-api/#assets-openapi-reference) for more detailed information on the response codes you may expect if authentication fails and what they mean.

### View Existing Assets

To test the creation of the Custom integration and the configuration of the bearer token file (`rkvst-bearer.txt`), query the assets API
```bash
curl -H "@rkvst-bearer.txt" \
    https://app.rkvst.io/archivist/v2/assets | jq
```

If you have existing assets, the output will be similar to:
```json
{
  "assets": [
    {
      "identity": "assets/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "behaviours": [
        "AssetCreator",
        "RecordEvidence",
        "Builtin"
      ],
      "attributes": {
        "length": "40'",
        "weight": "20000-lbs",
        "width": "8'",
        "arc_description": "A shipping container being tracked",
        "arc_display_name": "New Shipping Container #1",
        "arc_display_type": "Shipping Container",
        "arc_home_location_identity": "locations/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
        "height": "8'"
      },
      "confirmation_status": "CONFIRMED",
      "tracked": "TRACKED",
      "owner": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "at_time": "2023-09-22T03:39:46Z",
      "storage_integrity": "TENANT_STORAGE",
      "proof_mechanism": "SIMPLE_HASH",
      "chain_id": "8275868384",
      "public": false,
      "tenant_identity": "tenant/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
    }
  ],
  "next_page_token": ""
}
```

If the output is an empty structure, you may either not have any assets, or misconfigured the [Access Policy](#grant-permissions-to-custom-integration).
```json
{
  "assets": [],
  "next_page_token": ""
}
```

In the <a href="https://app.rkvst.io/" target="_blank">RKVST App</a>, Navigate to `Assets` confirm existing assets. If assets exist, confirm the `CLIENT_ID`, `SECRET` and `Access Policy` are configured and referenced properly.

## Troubleshooting Token Generation

The header and payload of the `TOKEN` may be examined with the following commands. This is useful when investigating if tokens contain the correct custom claims or tokens that may appear malformed.

{{< warning >}}
**Warning:** Decoding tokens with an online service exposes details about your RKVST until you delete the test secret.
{{< /warning >}}

1. View the Header
    ```bash
    echo -n $TOKEN | cut -d '.' -f 1 | base64 -d | jq
    ```
    Generates output similar to:
    ```json
    {
      "alg": "RS256",
      "typ": "at+jwt",
      "kid": "devidp"
    }
    ```
1. View the Payload
    ```bash
    echo -n $TOKEN | cut -d '.' -f 2 | base64 -d | jq
    ```
    Generates output similar to:
    ```json
    {
      "jit_tenant_id": "tenant/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "name": "my-token",
      "jit_tier": "FREE",
      "jti": "CCIH_QsZsM6FKzwBR6L5Z",
      "sub": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "iat": 1695254038,
      "exp": 1695257698,
      "client_id": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "iss": "https://app.rkvst.io/appidpv1",
      "aud": "https://app.rkvst.io/archivist"
    }
    ```
