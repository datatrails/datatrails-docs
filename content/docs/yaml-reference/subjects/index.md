## Subjects Create

This action creates a subject using their `wallet_pub_key` and `tessera_pub_key`. Adding a `subject_label` allows the subject to be referenced in later YAML Runner steps.

```yaml
---
steps:
  - step:
      action: SUBJECTS_CREATE
      description: Create a subjects entity.
      print_response: true
      subject_label: A subject
    display_name: A subject
    wallet_pub_key:
      - wallet_pub_key1
    tessera_pub_key:
      - tessera_pub_key2
```

## Subjects Create From base64

This action creates a subject using their base64 `subject_string`. Adding a `subject_label` allows the subject to be referenced in later YAML Runner steps.

For example:

```yaml
---
steps:
  - step:
      action: SUBJECTS_CREATE_FROM_B64
      description: Import a subjects entity.
      print_response: true
      subject_label: An imported subject
    display_name: An imported subject
    subject_string: >-

## Subjects Update

To update a subject's entity, the `subject_label` from a previous action in the YAML Runner steps is required. The `subject_label` may also be specified as the Subject ID of an existing subject, in the form `subjects/<subject-id`.

`display_name`, `wallet_pub_key`, and `tessera_pub_key` are optional, but at least one must be specified. 

```yaml
---
steps:
  - step:
      action: SUBJECTS_UPDATE
      description: Update a subjects entity.
      print_response: true
      subject_label: A subject
    display_name: A subject
    wallet_pub_key:
      - wallet_pub_key1
      - wallet_pub_key2
    tessera_pub_key:
      - tessera_pub_key1
      - tessera_pub_key2
```

## Subjects Delete

This action deletes the specified subject. 

`subject_label` is required, and may be specified as the friendly name defined in a previous step or as the Subject ID of an existing subject, in the form `subjects/<subject-id>`.

```yaml 
---
steps:
  - step:
      action: SUBJECTS_DELETE
      description: Delete subject
      print_response: true
      subject_label: A subject
```

## Subjects Read

This action allows you to read the details for the specified subject. Setting `print_response: true` is necessary to print the full output. 

`subject_label` is required, and may be specified as the friendly name defined in a previous step or as the Subject ID of an existing subject, in the form `subjects/<subject-id>`.

```yaml
---
steps:
  - step:
      action: SUBJECTS_READ
      description: Read subject
      print_response: true
      subject_label: subjects/<subject-id>
```

## Subjects List

This action returns a list of all subjects that meet your specified criteria. Setting `print_response: true` is necessary to print the full output. 

For example, to list all subjects with the name John Doe: 

```yaml
---
steps:
  - step:
      action: SUBJECTS_LIST
      description: List all subjects with name John Doe
      print_response: true
    display_name: John Doe
```

## Subjects Count

This action returns a count of all subjects that meet your specified criteria. Setting `print_response: true` is necessary to print the full output. 

```yaml
---
steps:
  - step:
      action: SUBJECTS_COUNT
      description: Count all subjects
      print_response: true
    display_name: John Doe
```

## Subjects Wait for Confirmation

This action tells the YAML Runner to wait before proceeding to the next step until all subjects that meet your specified criteria are confirmed. 

`subject_label` is required, and may be specified as the friendly name defined in a previous step or as the Subject ID of an existing subject, in the form `subjects/<subject-id>`.

```yaml
---
steps:
  - step:
      action: SUBJECTS_WAIT_FOR_CONFIRMATION
      description: Wait for all subjects to be confirmed
      print_response: true
      subject_label: A subject
```
