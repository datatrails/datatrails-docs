## Compliance API Examples

Create the [bearer_token](../../setup-and-administration/getting-access-tokens-using-app-registrations) and store in a file in a secure local directory with 0600 permissions.

### Types of Compliance Policies

Compliance Posture is measured against user-defined rule sets called Compliance Policies.

Compliance policies are created once and then Assets can be tested against them at any point in time. 

For instance, a policy might state that “Maintenance Alarm Events must be addressed with a Maintenance Report Event recorded in 72 hours”. 

This creates a Compliance Policy object in the system against which any asset can be tested as needed.

RKVST allows users to define Compliance Policies of the following types:

#### COMPLIANCE_SINCE

This Compliance Policy checks if the time since the last occurence of a specific Event Type has elapsed a specified threshold. 

For example “Time since last Maintenance must be less than 72 hours”:

```json
{
    "compliance_type": "COMPLIANCE_SINCE",
    "description": "Maintenance should be performed every 72h",
    "display_name": "Regular Maintenance",
    "asset_filter": [
        { "or": ["attributes.arc_home_location_identity=locations/5eef2b71-35c1-4376-a166-6c64bfa72f4b"]}
    ],
    "event_display_type": "Maintenance Performed",
    "time_period_seconds": "259200"
}
```

{{< table >}}
| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `event_display_type` | Type of event we want to check with this compliance policy |
| `time_period_seconds` | The maximum amount of time allowed since a specified event type last occurred in seconds |
{{< /table >}}

#### COMPLIANCE_CURRENT_OUTSTANDING

This Compliance Policy will only pass if there is an associated closing event addressing a specified outstanding event.

To correlate events define the attribute `arc_correlation_value` in the Event Attributes and set it to the same value on each pair of events that are to be associated. 

{{< note >}}
**Note:** To properly track and assess Events, the `arc_correlation_value` should be unique to each pair of events.
{{< /note >}}

For example defining pairs of Events like `Maintenance Request` and `Maintenance Performed`: 

```json
{
    "compliance_type": "COMPLIANCE_CURRENT_OUTSTANDING",
    "description": "There should be no outstanding Maintenance Requests",
    "display_name": "Outstanding Maintenance Requests",
    "asset_filter": [
        { "or": ["attributes.arc_home_location_identity=locations/5eef2b71-35c1-4376-a166-6c64bfa72f4b"]}
    ],
    "event_display_type": "Maintenance Request",
    "closing_event_display_type":  "Maintenance Performed"
}
```

{{< table >}}
| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `event_display_type` | Type of event that should be addressed by the event defined in `closing_event_display_type` |
| `closing_event_display_type` | Type of event addressing the event defined in `event_display_type` |
{{< /table >}}

#### COMPLIANCE_PERIOD_OUTSTANDING

This Compliance Policy will only pass if the time between a pair of correlated events did not exceed the defined threshold. 

To correlate events define the attribute `arc_correlation_value` in the Event Attributes and set it to the same value on each pair of events that are to be associated. 

{{< note >}}
**Note:** To properly track and assess Events, the `arc_correlation_value` should be unique to each pair of events.
{{< /note >}}

For example, a policy checking that the time between `Maintenance Request` and `Maintenance Performed` Events does not exceed the maximum 72 hours:
```json
{
    "compliance_type": "COMPLIANCE_PERIOD_OUTSTANDING",
    "description": "There should be no outstanding Maintenance Requests",
    "display_name": "Outstanding Maintenance Requests",
    "asset_filter": [
        { "or": ["attributes.arc_home_location_identity=locations/5eef2b71-35c1-4376-a166-6c64bfa72f4b"]}
    ],
    "event_display_type": "Maintenance Request",
    "closing_event_display_type":  "Maintenance Performed",
    "time_period_seconds": "259200"
}
```

{{< table >}}
| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `event_display_type` | Type of event that should be addressed by the event defined in `closing_event_display_type` |
| `closing_event_display_type` | Type of event addressing the event defined in `event_display_type` |
| `time_period_seconds` | Maximum amount of time that can elapse between associated events in seconds |
{{< /table >}}

#### COMPLIANCE_DYNAMIC_TOLERANCE

This Compliance Policy will only pass if the time between correlated events is not excessively different to the observed average normal duration for similar events.

To correlate events define the attribute `arc_correlation_value` in the Event Attributes and set it to the same value on each pair of events that are to be associated. 

{{< note >}}
**Note:** To properly track and assess Events, the `arc_correlation_value` should be unique to each pair of events.
{{< /note >}}

For example, a policy checking that the time between `Maintenance Request` and `Maintenance Performed` Events in the last week does not exceed a variability of 0.5 standard deviations around the mean:

```json
{
    "compliance_type": "COMPLIANCE_DYNAMIC_TOLERANCE",
    "description": "Average time between Maintenance Requested/Performed",
    "display_name": "Outlying Maintenance Requests",
    "asset_filter": [
        { "or": ["attributes.arc_home_location_identity=locations/5eef2b71-35c1-4376-a166-6c64bfa72f4b"]}
    ],
    "event_display_type": "Maintenance Request",
    "closing_event_display_type": "Maintenance Performed",
    "dynamic_window": 604800,
    "dynamic_variability": 0.5
}
```

{{< table >}}
| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `event_display_type` | Type of event that should be addressed by the event defined in `closing_event_display_type` |
| `closing_event_display_type` | Type of event addressing the event defined in `event_display_type` |
| `dynamic_window` | Number of seconds in the past - only events in this time window are considered. |
| `dynamic_variability` | Exceeding this number of standard deviations from the mean will cause compliance to fail for a particular pair of matching events. |
{{< /table >}}

#### COMPLIANCE_RICHNESS

This Compliance Policy will only pass if Attributes are within expected bounds or otherwise meet defined conditions.

An assertion is comprised of: an attribute name, a comparison value and an operator to compare with; for example `rad<7`. 

The operator can be one of six relational operators: equal to, not equal to, greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, less than or equal to; `[=|!=|>|<|>=|<=]`.

Assertions are comprised of two lists, an inner list and outer list. The inner list states that, if any of the assertions pass, then the list is compliant (`OR` logic). For example: 

```json
{“or”: [“rad<7”, “rad=10”]}. 
```

The outer list states that, all inner lists need to be compliant in order for the policy to be compliant (`AND` logic).

Compliance is a signal, not a perfect answer. Therefore equivilence of floats is exact, not approximate.

```json
{
    "compliance_type": "COMPLIANCE_RICHNESS",
    "description": "Rad level is less than 7",
    "display_name": "Rad limit",
    "asset_filter": [
        { "or": ["attributes.arc_home_location_identity=locations/5eef2b71-35c1-4376-a166-6c64bfa72f4b"]}
    ],
    "richness_assertions": [
        { "or": ["rad<7"]}
    ],
}
```

{{< table >}}
| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `richness_assertions`| The assertions to be made, against asset attributes, to check if the asset is compliant. |
{{< /table >}}

### Compliance Policy Creation

Create a Policy with:

```bash
curl -v -X POST \
    -H "@$BEARER_TOKEN_FILE" \
    -H "Content-type: application/json" \
    -d "@/path/to/jsonfile" \
    https://app.rkvst.io/archivist/v1/compliance_policies
```

Using data from `/path/to/jsonfile` in the format described in [Types of Compliance Policies](./types-of-compliance-policies).

Sample response:

```json
{
    "identity": "compliance_policies/6a951b62-0a26-4c22-a886-1082297b063b",
    "compliance_type": "COMPLIANCE_CURRENT_OUTSTANDING",
    "description": "There should be no outstanding Maintenance Requests",
    "display_name": "Outstanding Maintenance Requests",
    "asset_filter": [
        { "or": ["attributes.arc_home_location_identity=locations/5eef2b71-35c1-4376-a166-6c64bfa72f4b"]}
    ],
    "event_display_type": "Maintenance Request",
    "closing_event_display_type":  "Maintenance Performed",
    "time_period_seconds": "259200"
}
```

### Checking Compliance

The compliancev1 endpoint reports on the status of an Asset’s Compliance with Compliance Policies.

Query the endpoint:

```bash
curl -v -X GET \
    -H "@$BEARER_TOKEN_FILE" \
    https://app.rkvst.io/archivist/v1/compliance/assets/6a951b62-0a26-4c22-a886-1082297b063b
```

or if determining compliance at some historical date:

```bash
curl -v -X GET \
    -H "@$BEARER_TOKEN_FILE" \
    "https://app.rkvst.io/archivist/v1/compliance/assets/6a951b62-0a26-4c22-a886-1082297b063b?compliant_at=2019-11-27T14:44:19Z"
```
The response is:

```json
{
    "compliant": true,
    "compliance": [
        {
            "compliance_policy_identity": "compliance_policies/0000-0000-000000000-00000000",
            "compliant": true,
            "reason": ""
        }
    ],
    "compliant_at": "2019-11-27T14:44:19Z"
}
```
