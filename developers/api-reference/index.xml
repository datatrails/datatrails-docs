Asset based Events: where a series of Events are grounded to a specific Asset. Asset-free Events (preview) : where events can be correlated across pre-defined Trails. The Asset-free Events implementation is the future focus of the DataTrails platform providing the capabilities of Asset based events, with broader flexibility, performance and scalability. Asset-free Events are currently in preview, inviting early developer feedback.
The transition to Asset-free Events involves removing the dependency to anchoring Events in an Asset and shifting from mutable Asset Attributes to immutable Event Attributes.</description></item><item><title>Asset-Events API</title><link>https://docs.datatrails.ai/developers/api-reference/asset-events-api/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jun 2021 11:48:40 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://docs.datatrails.ai/developers/api-reference/asset-events-api/</guid><description>DataTrails provides two mechanisms for persisting provenance metadata:
