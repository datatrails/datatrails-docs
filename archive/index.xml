Having a receipt for a DataTrails Event allows you to prove that you recorded the Event on the DataTrails Blockchain, independent of DataTrails.
Receipts can be retrieved for Simple Hash Events once they have been confirmed and anchored.
A user may get a receipt for any Event they have recorded on the system. You must be an Administrator for your Tenancy to retrieve receipts for any Event within the Tenancy, including those shared by other organizations.</description></item></channel></rss>
