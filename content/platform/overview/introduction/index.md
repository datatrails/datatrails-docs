DataTrails provides Provenance as a Service to prove the origins and trustworthiness of the data that powers your applications.

DataTrails enables enterprises to build trust in data such as documents, images and AI models by ensuring that you know the origin and history of the data that you are using.
This can also be applied to multi-party data such as software and supply chain artifacts allowing you to make sure that processes are fit for purpose to comply with IT controls, corporate policies, and government regulations.

DataTrails permanently records evidence into an **Immutable Audit Trail** to bring a superior level of trust in data for faster, confident decisions with lower business risk by combining:

- **Metadata Governance** - Empower the right people in organizations to set, enforce, and execute detailed sharing policies for provenance metadata.
- **Authenticated Provenance** - Deliver full traceability on all internal and external data sources to speed and assure digital decisions.
- **Continuous Accountability** - Instantly auditable evidence “Proves Who Did What When” for any shared data to speed audit and root cause investigations.
- **Persistent Integrity** - Create a complete, unbroken, and permanent record of shared Event transactions, delivering continuous assurance for faster digital decisions.

DataTrails delivers assured metadata in a single line of code in a way that makes recording and auditing the full lifecycle of data simple.
Any authorized participant (including a user, a software agent or an endpoint device) can register the Events that they are involved in.

Users of the data can see a full picture of the data’s origin and history and by understanding *Who Did What When*, human actors and software/AI systems can make stronger real-time judgments about the trustworthiness of your data.
