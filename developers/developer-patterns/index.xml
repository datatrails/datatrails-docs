This is done using either the Settings or Integrations menus in the DataTrails UI or by using the App Registrations API directly. Note: App Registration is the old name for a Custom Integration. Custom Integrations have a CLIENT_ID and a SECRET, these are used to authenticate with DataTrails IAM endpoints using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).</description></item><item><title>Containers as Assets</title><link>https://docs.datatrails.ai/developers/developer-patterns/containers-as-assets/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 May 2021 15:18:01 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://docs.datatrails.ai/developers/developer-patterns/containers-as-assets/</guid><description>Represent Containers Using DataTrails DataTrails Assets can be used to track the status, contents, location, and other key attributes of containers over time. This can also be done for containers within containers. For example, you may wish to track bags inside boxes that are inside a shipping container being transported on a train.
Create a Container Asset A Container Asset is not a special type of asset, it is a label that is given to an Asset that has been created to represent a container.</description></item><item><title>Namespace</title><link>https://docs.datatrails.ai/developers/developer-patterns/namespace/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 May 2021 15:18:01 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://docs.datatrails.ai/developers/developer-patterns/namespace/</guid><description>Namespace is a tool that can be used to prevent unwanted interactions when multiple users are performing testing in the same Tenancy. Using two separate namespaces prevents collisions that may cause undesirable results by allowing multiple users to interact with the same Assets and Events without interrupting each other.
Namespace can be added as an attribute within the files you are testing, or as a variable in your Bash environment.</description></item><item><title>Document Profile</title><link>https://docs.datatrails.ai/developers/developer-patterns/document-profile/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 May 2021 15:18:01 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://docs.datatrails.ai/developers/developer-patterns/document-profile/</guid><description>The DataTrails document profile is a set of suggested Asset and Event attributes that allow you to trace the lifecycle of a document.
Profile Attribute Namespace The document_ prefix is used to designate attributes that are part of the profile. Some of these are interpreted by DataTrails and others are guidelines.

With it, you can explore the merkle log and prove the inclusion of your event data. By default it connects to the DataTrails service to obtain a copy of the merkle log. Veracity can also work from copies of the merkle log on disk.
In this guide we&amp;rsquo;ll explore how you can use Veracity to:
Prove the inclusion of events that matter in the DataTrails merkle log with verify-included Explore the DataTrails merkle log using the node command Prerequisites Have downloaded and installed Veracity using the instructions found here Verifying Event Data DataTrails records the events that matter to your business and lets you prove them at a later date.</description></item><item><title>Navigating the Merkle Log</title><link>https://docs.datatrails.ai/developers/developer-patterns/navigating-merklelogs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.datatrails.ai/developers/developer-patterns/navigating-merklelogs/</guid><description>This article explains how to navigate the Merkle Log, using the DataTrails Merkle Mountain Range implementation.
DataTrails publishes the data necessary for immediately verifying events to highly available commodity cloud storage. &amp;ldquo;Verifiable data&amp;rdquo; is synonymous with log or transparency log. Once verifiable data is written to the log it is never changed. The log only grows, it never shrinks and data in it never moves within the log.
To work with Merkle Log format, DataTrails provides open-source tooling for working in offline environments.</description></item><item><title>Massif blob pre-calculated offsets</title><link>https://docs.datatrails.ai/developers/developer-patterns/massif-blob-offset-tables/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.datatrails.ai/developers/developer-patterns/massif-blob-offset-tables/</guid><description>This page provides lookup tables for navigating the dynamic, but computable, offsets into the Merkle log binary format. The algorithms to reproduce this are relatively simple. DataTrails provides open-source implementations, but in many contexts it is simpler to use these pre-calculations. These tables can be made for any log configuration at any time, in part or in whole, without access to any specific log.
This is a quick review of the log format.</description></item><item><title>Verified Replication of the Datatrails Transparency Logs</title><link>https://docs.datatrails.ai/developers/developer-patterns/3rdparty-verification/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Aug 2024 19:35:35 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://docs.datatrails.ai/developers/developer-patterns/3rdparty-verification/</guid><description>Introduction Without the measures described in this article, it is still extremely challenging to compromise a transparency solution based on DataTrails.
To do so, the systems of more than just DataTrails need to be compromised in very specific ways. To illustrate this, consider this typical flow for how Data can be used in a transparent and tamper evident way with DataTrails.
Replicated Transparency Logs This is already a very robust process.</description></item><item><title>Quickstart: SCITT Statements (Preview)</title><link>https://docs.datatrails.ai/developers/developer-patterns/scitt-api/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jun 2021 13:49:35 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://docs.datatrails.ai/developers/developer-patterns/scitt-api/</guid><description>The SCITT API is currently in preview and subject to change The Supply Chain Integrity, Transparency and Trust (SCITT) initiative is a set of IETF standards for managing the compliance and auditability of goods and services across end-to-end supply chains. SCITT supports the ongoing verification of goods and services where the authenticity of entities, evidence, policy, and artifacts can be assured and the actions of entities can be guaranteed to be authorized, non-repudiable, immutable, and auditable.</description></item></channel></rss>
