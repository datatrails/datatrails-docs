Formerly known as an App Registration                                                             |
| [document hash](/developers/developer-patterns/document-profile/) | cryptographic 'fingerprint' of a file or document that proves it is unmodified|
| [document status](/developers/developer-patterns/document-profile/) | when dealing with Document profile Assets in DataTrails you can attach certain lifecycle stage metadata to them such as 'Draft', 'Published', or 'Withdrawn' in order to properly convey whether or not someone checking provenance of the document should rely on a particular version|
| [event](/platform/overview/core-concepts/#events)               | tracks key moments of an Asset lifecycle; details of Who Did What When to an Asset                                   |

| [event type](/platform/overview/creating-an-event-against-an-asset/)| events in DataTrails are labeled with a 'type' that signify what kind of evidence they relate to, for instance a 'Publish' event on a document, or a 'Shipping' event on physical goods.

| [verified domain](/platform/administration/verified-domain/)     | tenancy name visible to others in place of the tenancy ID when viewing the Asset Overview of a public Asset or a shared private Asset. Must be verified by the DataTrails team                                        |
