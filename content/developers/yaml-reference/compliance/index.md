## Compliance Policies Create

This action creates a Compliance Policy that assets may be tested against.

The specific fields required for creating Compliance Policies vary depending on the type of policy being used. Please see the [Compliance Policies](/platform/administration/compliance-policies/) section for details regarding Compliance Policy types and YAML Runner examples of each.

For example, a `COMPLIANCE_RICHNESS` policy that asserts radiation level must be less than 7:

```yaml
---
steps:
  - step:
      action: COMPLIANCE_POLICIES_CREATE
      description: Create COMPLIANCE_RICHNESS policy
      print_response: true
    description: "Radiation level must be less than 7"
    display_name: Rad Limit
    compliance_type: COMPLIANCE_RICHNESS
    asset_filter:
      - or: [ "attributes.arc_home_location_identity=locations/<location-id>" ]
    richness_assertions: 
      - or: [ "radiation_level<7" ]
```

## Compliance Compliant At

The `COMPLIANCE_COMPLIANT_AT` action checks an Asset against its Compliance Policies. 

`asset_label` is required, and may be specified as the friendly name defined in a previous step or as the Asset ID of an existing subject, in the form `assets/<asset-id>`. Setting `report: true` will trigger a report to be printed on the Asset's compliance status. 

```yaml
---
steps:
  - step:
      action: COMPLIANCE_COMPLIANT_AT
      description: Check Compliance of EV pump 1.
      report: true
      asset_label: ev pump 1
```
