The Attachments API enables attaching and querying Binary Large OBjects (BLOBs) such as documents, process artifacts and images to Assets and Events.

{{< note >}}
Attachments apply to [Asset-Events](/developers/api-reference/asset-events-api/), and Asset-free [Events](/developers/api-reference/events-api/) (preview).
There are subtle differences that are documented below.
{{< /note >}}

The steps to make an attachment include:

1. Uploading content to the DataTrails [Blobs API](/developers/api-reference/blobs-api/).
1. Attaching the blob to an [Asset](/developers/api-reference/assets-api/) or an [Event](/developers/api-reference/events-api/)
1. Querying the Attachment, through an Asset or an Event

### Asset-Event Attachments

Assets support attachments by creating an [Asset-Event](/developers/api-reference/asset-events-api/) with nested `arc_` [reserved attributes](/glossary/reserved-attributes/).

- `"arc_attribute_type": "arc_attachment"`
- `"arc_blob_identity": "blobs/b1234567-890b"`
- `"arc_blob_hash_alg": "SHA256"`
- `"arc_blob_hash_value": "h1234567h"`
- `"arc_file_name": "conformance.pdf"`
- `"arc_display_name": "Conformance Report"`

Example of an Asset-event with two attachments:

```json
  {
    "identity": "assets/a1234567-890a/events/e1234567-890e",
    "asset_identity": "assets/a1234567-890a",
    "event_attributes": {
      "arc_description": "Conformance approved for version 1.6",
      "arc_display_type": "Conformance Report",
      "conformance_report": {
        "arc_attribute_type": "arc_attachment",
        "arc_blob_identity": "blobs/b1234567-890b",
        "arc_blob_hash_alg": "SHA256",
        "arc_blob_hash_value": "h1234567h",
        "arc_file_name": "conformance.pdf",
        "arc_display_name": "Conformance Report"
      },
      "security_report": {
        "arc_attribute_type": "arc_attachment",
        "arc_blob_identity": "blobs/b890123-456b",
        "arc_blob_hash_alg": "SHA256",
        "arc_blob_hash_value": "h8901234h",
        "arc_file_name": "security-report.pdf",
        "arc_display_name": "Security Report"
      }
    },
    "..."
  }
```

The name of the parent attribute (`"conformance_report"`) can be any value, providing a means to name multiple attachments within a single event, such as the additional `"security_report"` attachment.

The DataTrails platform evaluates `"arc_attribute_type": "arc_attachment"` to reference a DataTrails [Blob](/developers/api-reference/blobs-api/) based attachment.

## Asset-Event Attachment API Examples

- Create the [bearer_token](/developers/developer-patterns/getting-access-tokens-using-app-registrations) and store in a file in a secure local directory with 0600 permissions.

- Upload the content of the Attachment using the [Blobs API](/developers/api-reference/blobs-api/).

### Asset-Event Attachment Variables

- To associate an existing Blob, set the `ASSET_ID`, `BLOB_ID`, `BLOB_HASH` value and `BLOB_FILE` from the [Blobs API](/developers/api-reference/blobs-api/):

  {{< note >}}
  The `BLOB_HASH` is required, as it creates integrity protection between the content uploaded through the Blobs API, and the integrity protected reference of the Attachment.
  Storing the hash in the attachment assures any tampering of the blob storage, including tampering within the DataTrails platform, would be evident.
  
  When retrieving the blob, the hash retrieved should be compared to the hash of the Attachment API to assure the content has not been tampered with.
  {{< /note >}}

  ```bash
  ASSET_ID=<asset-id>
  BLOB_ID=<blob-id>
  BLOB_HASH=<hash-value>
  BLOB_FILE=conformance.pdf
  ```

  Example:

  ASSET_ID=assets/a1234567-890a  
  BLOB_ID=blobs/b1234567-890b  
  BLOB_HASH=h1234567h  
  BLOB_FILE=conformance.pdf

### Create an Asset-Event Attachment

- Create an event, referencing the Blob as an integrity protected Attachment:

  ```bash
  cat > /tmp/event.json <<EOF
  {
    "operation": "Record",
    "behaviour": "RecordEvidence",
    "event_attributes": {
      "arc_display_type": "Safety Conformance",
      "arc_description": "Safety conformance approved for version 1.6.",
      "conformance_report": {
        "arc_attribute_type": "arc_attachment",
        "arc_blob_hash_value": "$BLOB_HASH",
        "arc_blob_identity": "$BLOB_ID",
        "arc_blob_hash_alg": "SHA256",
        "arc_file_name": "$BLOB_FILE",
        "arc_display_name": "Conformance Report"
      }
    }
  }
  EOF
  ```

- Post to the Asset resource:

  ```bash
  curl -X POST \
    -H "@$HOME/.datatrails/bearer-token.txt" \
    -H "Content-type: application/json" \
    -d "@/tmp/event.json" \
    https://app.datatrails.ai/archivist/v2/$ASSET_ID/events \
    | jq
  ```

  The response:

  ```json
  {
    "identity": "assets/a1234567-890a/events/e1234567-890e",
    "asset_identity": "assets/a1234567-890a",
    "event_attributes": {
      "arc_description": "Safety conformance approved for version 1.6.",
      "conformance_report": {
        "arc_attribute_type": "arc_attachment",
        "arc_blob_hash_value": "h1234567h",
        "arc_blob_identity": "blobs/b1234567-890b",
        "arc_blob_hash_alg": "SHA256",
        "arc_file_name": "cat.jpg",
        "arc_display_name": "Conformance Report"
      },
      "arc_display_type": "Safety Conformance"
    },
    "..."
  }
  ```

### Retrieve a Specific Attachment on an Asset

```bash
curl -H "@$HOME/.datatrails/bearer-token.txt" \
    --output $BLOB_FILE
    https://app.datatrails.ai/archivist/v2/attachments/$ASSET_ID/$BLOB_ID
```

### Retrieve a Specific Attachment on an Event

```bash
ASSET_ID=<asset-id>
curl -H "@$HOME/.datatrails/bearer-token.txt" \
    https://app.datatrails.ai/archivist/v2/attachments/assets/$ASSET_ID/events/$EVENT_ID/$ATTACHMENT_ID
```

### Retrieve Information About a Specific Attachment

Itâ€™s also possible to retrieve information about specific attachment using the Attachments API.

This information includes the `scanned_status` of the attachment.
Attachment scanning happens in batch, daily.

To do so, simply issue a request as above with the suffix `/info`.

```bash
curl -H "@$HOME/.datatrails/bearer-token.txt" \
    https://app.datatrails.ai/archivist/v2/attachments/assets/$ASSET_ID/$ATTACHMENT_ID/info
```

The response will include basic information about the attachment:

```json
{
  "hash": {
    "alg": "SHA256",
    "value": "xxxxxxxx"  },
  "identity": "attachments/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "issuer": "local",
  "mime_type": "image/jpeg",
  "size": 81254,
  "subject": "user@datatrails.ai",
  "tenantid": "tenant/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "timestamp_accepted": "2023-02-06T16:04:31Z",
  "scanned_status": "NOT_SCANNED",
  "scanned_bad_reason": "",
  "scanned_timestamp": ""
}
```

### Integrity Protecting External Content

To integrity protect content located external to the DataTrails platform, exclude the `"arc_attribute_type": "arc_attachment"`, `"arc_blob_identity"` and `"arc_display_name"` as not being relevant to external content.

  ```json
  cat > /tmp/event.json <<EOF
  {
    "operation": "Record",
    "behaviour": "RecordEvidence",
    "event_attributes": {
      "arc_blob_hash_value": "$BLOB_HASH",
      "arc_blob_hash_alg": "SHA256",
      "arc_file_name": "$BLOB_FILE"
    }
  }
  EOF
  ```

- Post to the Integrity protected content as an Event:

  ```bash
  curl -X POST \
    -H "@$HOME/.datatrails/bearer-token.txt" \
    -H "Content-type: application/json" \
    -d "@/tmp/event.json" \
    https://app.datatrails.ai/archivist/v2/assets/$ASSET_ID/events \
    | jq
  ```

- Capture the new Event ID from above:

  ```bash
  EVENT_ID=<event-id>
  ```

- Query the newly created Event, with integrity protection:

  ```bash
  curl -H "@$HOME/.datatrails/bearer-token.txt" \
      https://app.datatrails.ai/archivist/v2/assets/$ASSET_ID/events/$EVENT_ID \
      | jq
  ```
