## Overview
Maintaining and publishing an accurate Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is an essential cybersecurity activity for all vendors of critical software and cyber physical systems. However, publishing is not enough: users of the software also need to be able to find the information and be able to understand it in order to make strong and rational decisions about their own system security.

In its [recommendations for the minimum required elements of an SBOM](https://www.ntia.gov/report/2021/minimum-elements-software-bill-materials-sbom), the NTIA identifies the need to balance transparency with access controls ("*SBOMs should be available in a timely fashion to those who need them and must have appropriate access permissions and roles in place*"), and illustrates in its [NTIA SBOM Proof of Concept](https://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/publications/ntia_sbom_energy_pocplanning.pdf) the need for strong stakeholder community management and a trusted SBOM data sharing mechanism which protects the interests of all parties.

The RKVST Software Package profile is a set of suggested Asset and Event attributes that offers a solution to this sharing and distribution problem: vendors retain control of their proprietary information and release processes while customers have assured and reliable visibility into their digital supply chain risks with reliable access to current and historical SBOM data for the components they rely on.

As an Asset, a Software Package may hold many different SBOMs over its lifecycle representing the introduction of new releases and versions of the Software Package. Each ‘Release’ is recorded as an Event to capture the known SBOM at the time.

If a particular Software Package has constituent components composed of other Software Package Assets this would be tracked within the SBOM of the component Supplied Software Package, ensuring full traceability across the Supply Chain.

##### Software Package Profile Attribute Namespace
The `sbom_` prefix is used to designate attributes that are part of the profile. Some of these are interpreted by RKVST and others are guidelines.
{{< /note >}}

##### Public SBOM
You must express `public` as an asset attribute and have `true` as a property to make an SBOM public. The default is 'false'.

{{< tabs name="create_sbom_public" >}}
{{{< tab name="UI" >}}
Select `Register Asset` from the sidebar and fill in the desired details.
Set the `Attest Publicly` toggle to `On`.

{{< img src="PublicCheck.png" alt="Rectangle" caption="<em>Check Asset as Public</em>" class="border-0" >}}
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab name="YAML" >}}
Create a YAML file with your desired Asset details. Set keyword `public` to true.

```yaml

## Software Package Profile Event Types and Attributes

### Release Event

A Release is the event used by a Supplier to provide an SBOM for their Software Package in RKVST.

The Release attributes tracked in RKVST should minimally represent the base information required by the NTIA standard and be recorded in two, separate, lists of attributes; **Asset Attributes** would track details about the latest release of the SBOM at the time of the event creation, the **Event Attributes** then track details about the release of the SBOM that is being submitted.

##### Exception
When used in tandem with Release Plan and Accepted events the exception is a useful record of when an emergency has caused a release to be pushed without needing an initial approval or plan.
{{< /note >}}

### Release Plan and Release Accepted

Release events can be optionally enhanced by using ‘Release Plan’ and ‘Release Accepted’ events alongside them.

Release Plan events demonstrate an intent to introduce a new release, it should describe which version you want to release and who wants to release it. For example, it could include draft release notes explaining what is being updated and why it should be updated.

Release Accepted events demonstrate an approval on a Release Plan to go forward, it may be that the plan details a need to introduce a fix for a specific vulnerability and the security team is needed to sign off the release going forward.

These events are not essential to the process so can be omitted in a standard or minimal deployment but they are actively encouraged. As they should not affect the information about the latest Software Package Release there should be no Asset Attributes included, other NTIA attributes may also not be necessary or not available until release (e.g. Component Hash).

The Key Attribute that should be recorded is the version of the release that is being planned and accepted.

### Release Plan

### Patch Event

Patches are often supplied to customer in an Out-Of-Band procedure to address critical bugs or vulnerabilities, usually with a short-term turnaround that can be outside the normal release cadence.

It is typically expected a Patch should contain its own SBOM separate to the Primary SBOM.

These Event types are used for vulnerability management.
The first is to disclose knowledge of a vulnerability and the second is to update the status of the vulnerability after investigation is complete.
