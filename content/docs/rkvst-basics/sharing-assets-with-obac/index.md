{{< caution >}}
**Caution:** You will only have access to the `Access Policies` screen if you are a Root User in your organization.

**Warning:** To use OBAC you will need to share with an external organization.
{{< /warning >}}

Organization-Based Access Control (OBAC) policies have a lot in common with Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) policies; they apply the same controls with two different classes of Actor.

Where they differ is that OBAC shares only with Root Users of an External Organization; the External Root User must then apply ABAC to establish appropriate access for their own organization's Non-Root Users.

## Adding External Organizations to Allow Sharing

In order to share Assets and their details with another Organization or Tenant, we must first import the ID of the External Organization.

### Finding Your Own ID

1. As a Root User, navigate to `Access Policies`

2. Select the Subjects Tab and your Organization's ID will be contained within the `Self` box.

This string is the one you should share with a 3rd Party who wants to share their data with you.

### Importing another Organization's ID

1. As a Root User, navigate to `Access Policies`.

2. Select the Subjects Tab and then `Import Subject`.

3. You will be presented with a form; the `Subject String` is the ID of the Organization with which you wish to share Asset evidence. The `Name` is a Friendly Name for you to label the imported organization.

## Creating an OBAC Policy

OBAC creation uses many of the same steps, filters, controls, and forms as ABAC Policies.

It is possible to mix-and-match ABAC and OBAC Permission Groups in the same policy if you so wish.

1. Navigate to the `Access Policies` section on the Sidebar of the RKVST Dashboard.

{{< img src="PolicyManage.png" alt="Rectangle" caption="<em>Managing Policies</em>" class="border-0" >}}

2. Here you will see any existing policies, select `Add Policy`.

{{< img src="PolicyAdd.png" alt="Rectangle" caption="<em>Adding a Policy</em>" class="border-0" >}}

3. When you add a policy the following form will appear:

{{< img src="PolicyForm.png" alt="Rectangle" caption="<em>Policy Web Form</em>" class="border-0" >}}

4. Here you can begin applying filters to your Policy for the right assets. In this case, we're going to filter for any Assets in the `UK Factory` Location created earlier.

{{< img src="PolicyOBACFilter.png" alt="Rectangle" caption="<em>Filtering for specific Assets and Locations</em>" class="border-0" >}}

5. Next, we select the `Permissions` Tab to set which Organizations can read and write certain Asset attributes, as well as Event visibility.

{{< img src="PolicyOBACForm.png" alt="Rectangle" caption="<em>Default view of Policy Permissions</em>" class="border-0" >}}

6. In our case, we want the `Organization` actor, which implies OBAC. Type the Friendly Name of the Organization we wish to share with into the box and we should see a prepopulated drop-down search.

{{< note >}} **Note:** You will need to have imported another Organization's ID before you can specify a policy to share information with that Organization. {{< /note >}}

{{< img src="PolicyOBACUsers.png" alt="Rectangle" caption="<em>Adding a specific User to a Policy</em>" class="border-0" >}}

7. When the relevant controls are in place, we then add the Permission Group to the policy.

Note we have included RKVST-significant atributes: `arc_display_name` and `arc_display_type` which brings visibility to the Name and Type of Asset being shared. 

{{< img src="PolicyOBACPermissions.png" alt="Rectangle" caption="<em>Permitted Attributes on an Asset</em>" class="border-0" >}}

8. Once complete, submit the policy and check the Asset is shared appropriately; Mandy should only be able to see the Name and Type of Asset as well as the Asset's custom `Weight` attribute.

{{< img src="PolicyOBACMandyView.png" alt="Rectangle" caption="<em>Mandy's view as a Root User of the External Organization</em>" class="border-0" >}}

By comparison, our Root User, Jill, can see the full details of the Asset:

{{< img src="PolicyOBACJillView.png" alt="Rectangle" caption="<em>Jill's view as a Root User</em>" class="border-0" >}}

9. If Mandy wishes to share what she can to Non-Root Users within her organization, it is her responsibility to create an ABAC Policy as she would any other Asset she has access to.

There are many possible fine-grained controls and as such ABAC and OBAC Policy Creation is an extensive topic. To find out more, head over to the [IAM Policies API Reference](../../api-reference/iam-policies-api/).
