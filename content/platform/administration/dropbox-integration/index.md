## The Dropbox Integration
This integration allows you to link your RKVST tenancy directly with Dropbox to automatically add provenance to your files. 

During the set up process, any files found in the configured directories and their subfolders will always be added to your RKVST tenancy as a **public** [Document Profile Asset](/developers/developer-patterns/document-profile/). These assets can be verified using [Instaproof](/platform/overview/instaproof/).

From then on, each time a new file is created a corresponding asset will also be created on RKVST and any modifications to an existing file will be registered as a [Publish Event](/developers/developer-patterns/document-profile/#publish-event) on the correct asset. 

{{< note >}}
**Note:** RKVST will **never** upload a copy of the file.

The file name and file path are masked in the UI. This is intentional so that private information cannot be accidentally released via the Instaproof search results and because RKVST is not intended to replace the excellent file management functionality that is provided by Dropbox.<br>
Knowledge of the filename is not needed to prove provenance because Instaproof will attest and verify the content of a file even if the filename has been changed.
