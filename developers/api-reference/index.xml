App Registrations API Examples The App Registrations API enables you to create and manage application identities with access to your DataTrails Tenancy.</description></item><item><title>Assets API</title><link>https://docs.datatrails.ai/developers/api-reference/assets-api/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jun 2021 11:39:03 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://docs.datatrails.ai/developers/api-reference/assets-api/</guid><description>DataTrails provides two mechanisms for persisting provenance metadata:
Asset based Events: where a series of Events are grounded to a specific Asset. Asset-free Events (preview) : where events can be correlated across pre-defined Trails. The Asset-free Events implementation is the future focus of the DataTrails platform providing the capabilities of Asset based events, with broader flexibility, performance and scalability. Asset-free Events are currently in preview, inviting early developer feedback.
The transition to Asset-free Events involves removing the dependency to anchoring Events in an Asset and shifting from mutable Asset Attributes to immutable Event Attributes.</description></item><item><title>Asset-Events API</title><link>https://docs.datatrails.ai/developers/api-reference/asset-events-api/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jun 2021 11:48:40 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://docs.datatrails.ai/developers/api-reference/asset-events-api/</guid><description>DataTrails provides two mechanisms for persisting provenance metadata:

Attachments apply to Asset-Events, and Asset-free Events (preview). There are subtle differences that are documented below. The steps to make an attachment include:
Uploading content to the DataTrails Blobs API. Attaching the blob to an Asset or an Event Querying the Attachment, through an Asset or an Event Asset-Event Attachments Assets support attachments by creating an Asset-Event with nested arc_ reserved attributes.</description></item><item><title>Blobs API</title><link>https://docs.datatrails.ai/developers/api-reference/blobs-api/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jun 2021 13:32:57 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://docs.datatrails.ai/developers/api-reference/blobs-api/</guid><description>The Blobs API enables uploading Binary Large OBjects (BLOBs) such as documents, process artifacts and images, attaching them to Assets and Events (preview).
Note: Blobs cannot be searched or listed as a collection using the blobs resource. Blobs must be associated with an Asset or Event through an Attachment Attribute and can only be downloaded by users with appropriate access rights to that Attachment. Take note of the Blob ID returned in the API response, it will be needed for use with Assets and Events.</description></item><item><title>Events API (preview)</title><link>https://docs.datatrails.ai/developers/api-reference/events-api/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2025 11:48:40 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://docs.datatrails.ai/developers/api-reference/events-api/</guid><description>DataTrails provides two mechanisms for persisting provenance metadata:
