## App Registrations API Examples

The App Registrations API enables you to create and manage application identities with access to your RKVST tenant. 

It supports the OpenID Connect Client Credentials Flow, which means that for each application you register, a `CLIENT_ID` and `SECRET` are generated and returned.

These credentials are then used to request an access token from `https://app.rkvst.io/archivist/iam/v1/appidp/token`, which is used for API authentication to RKVST.

Each App Registration is created with non-root privileges by default.

To provide your credentials with access to the Assets and Events in your Tenancy, it is best practice to create an [ABAC policy](../iam-policies-api/) with specific, declared permissions. 

If you wish to give your credentials root user priviliges to access everything in your tenancy, you would use the `client-id` as the subject and `https://app.rkvst.io/appidpv1` as the issuer in either the `Manage RKVST` screen, or by using the [Root Users Endpoint in the Tenancies API](../tenancies-api/).
### Creating an Application

Create a JSON file with the parameters of your new application. Below is an example:

```json
{
    "display_name": "TrafficLight101",
    "custom_claims": {
      "serial_number": "TL1000000101",
      "has_cyclist_light": "true"
    }
}
```

Once you have created your file, you can then submit it to the RKVST API:

```bash
curl -X POST \
     -H "@$BEARER_TOKEN_FILE" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d "@/path/to/jsonfile" \
     https://app.rkvst.io/archivist/iam/v1/applications
```

An example response is shown below. 

The client secret ***must*** be taken note of at this point, as it will be redacted in any attempt to retrieve the application (shown as an empty string.)

```json
{
    "identity": "applications/d1fb6c87-faa9-4d56-b2fd-a5b70a9af065",
    "display_name": "TrafficLight101",
    "client_id": "d1fb6c87-faa9-4d56-b2fd-a5b70a9af065",
    "tenant_id": "tenant/53e6bed7-6f4c-4a37-8c4f-cf889f2b1aa6",
    "credentials": [
        {
            "secret":"a0c09972b6ac912a4d67815fef88093c81a99b49977d35ecf6d162631aa29173",
            "valid_from": "2021-09-21T16:43:19Z",
            "valid_until": "2022-09-21T16:43:19Z"
        }
    ],
    "custom_claims": {
        "serial_number": "TL1000000101",
        "has_cyclist_light": "true"
    }
}
```

{{< caution >}}
**Caution:** The expiry date refers to the secret only, any tokens generated with this secret will not automatically become invalid when the secret expires or is rotated. Each token has a TTL of 1 hour. 
{{< /caution >}}

#### Authenticating with your Application

Now that you've created an application, you get a token.

Replace `${CLIENT_ID}` with the application id, and `${SECRET}` with your secret from the application registration.

```bash
curl https://app.rkvst.io/archivist/iam/v1/appidp/token \
    --data-urlencode "grant_type=client_credentials" \
    --data-urlencode "client_id=${CLIENT_ID}" \
    --data-urlencode "client_secret=${SECRET}"
```

The token is found in the `.access_token` field and it is a base64 encoded [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/introduction/).

A common method to extract the token is to use `jq`, where `$RESPONSE` is the output your curl command:

```bash
TOKEN=$(echo -n $RESPONSE | jq -r .access_token)
```

You should then save the token to a local `bearer_token` file with `0600` permissions in the following format:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN
```

Where `$TOKEN` is the extracted token value.

You can then use this bearer token to interact with other RKVST services.

### Listing Applications

All of the applications created for your RKVST tenancy can be viewed using the following command.

```bash
curl -X GET \
     -H "@$BEARER_TOKEN_FILE" \
     https://app.rkvst.io/archivist/iam/v1/applications
```

### Viewing Applications

The following example shows how to view the details of a single application.

```bash
export IDENTITY="applications/d1fb6c87-faa9-4d56-b2fd-a5b70a9af065"

curl -X GET \
     -H "@$BEARER_TOKEN_FILE" \
     https://app.rkvst.io/archivist/iam/v1/${IDENTITY}
```
### Updating Applications

You may edit the display name and/or the custom claims of an Application.

Create a JSON file containing the details you wish to update, partial updating of Applications is also supported. Below is an example:

```json
{
    "custom_claims": {
      "has_cyclist_light": "false"
    }
}
```

Once you've created your file, submit it to the RKVST API:

```bash
export IDENTITY="applications/d1fb6c87-faa9-4d56-b2fd-a5b70a9af065"

curl -X PATCH \
     -H "@$BEARER_TOKEN_FILE" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d "@/path/to/json"
     https://app.rkvst.io/archivist/iam/v1/${IDENTITY}
```

Example response:

```json
{
    "identity": "applications/d1fb6c87-faa9-4d56-b2fd-a5b70a9af065",
    "display_name": "TrafficLight101",
    "client_id": "d1fb6c87-faa9-4d56-b2fd-a5b70a9af065",
    "tenant_id": "tenant/53e6bed7-6f4c-4a37-8c4f-cf889f2b1aa6",
    "credentials": [
        {
            "secret": "",
            "valid_from": "2021-09-21T16:43:19Z",
            "valid_until": "2022-09-21T16:43:19Z"
        }
    ],
    "custom_claims": {
        "has_cyclist_light": "false"
    }
}
```
### Regenerating Application Secrets

It is possible to regenerate the secret for an existing application. 

The expected response will be the same as for [creation](./#creating-an-application), but the credential entry will have been updated with a new secret, along with new expiry dates. 

Once again, you ***must*** take note of the secret at this point, as it will not be recoverable.

```bash
export IDENTITY="applications/d1fb6c87-faa9-4d56-b2fd-a5b70a9af065"

curl -X POST \
     -H "@$BEARER_TOKEN_FILE" \
     https://app.rkvst.io/archivist/iam/v1/${IDENTITY}:regenerate-secret
```

{{< caution >}}
**Caution:** The expiry date refers to the secret only, any tokens generated with this secret will not automatically become invalid when the secret expires or is rotated. Each token has a TTL of 1 hour. 
{{< /caution >}}

### Deleting Applications
The following example shows how to delete an application.

```bash
export IDENTITY="applications/d1fb6c87-faa9-4d56-b2fd-a5b70a9af065"

curl -X DELETE \
     -H "@$BEARER_TOKEN_FILE" \
     https://app.rkvst.io/archivist/iam/v1/${IDENTITY}
```
