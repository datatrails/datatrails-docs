{{< note >}}
This page is primarily intended for developers who will be writing applications that will use DataTrails for provenance. 
If you are looking for a simple way to test our API you might prefer our [Postman collection](https://www.postman.com/datatrails-official/workspace/datatrails-public-official/overview), the [YAML runner](/developers/yaml-reference/story-runner-components/) or the [Developers](https://app.datatrails.io) section of the web UI. 

Additional YAML examples can be found in the articles in the [Overview](/platform/overview/introduction/) section.

## Attachment API Examples

The Attachments API enables you to query Binary Large OBjects (BLOBs) such as documents, process artifacts and images that are attached to your evidence ledger. For details of how to actually attach these BLOBs to Events and Assets, see the [the Events API Reference](../events-api/#adding-attachments).

Create the [bearer_token](/developers/developer-patterns/getting-access-tokens-using-app-registrations) and store in a file in a secure local directory with 0600 permissions.

### Retrieve a Specific Attachment on an Asset

```bash
curl -v \
    -H "@$HOME/.datatrails/bearer-token.txt" \
    https://app.datatrails.ai/archivist/v2/attachments/assets/c04d5ecf-02e0-4be2-a014-ffbbf0e8ddeb/08838336-c357-460d-902a-3aba9528dd22
```

### Retrieve a Specific Attachment on an Event

```bash
curl -v \
    -H "@$HOME/.datatrails/bearer-token.txt" \
    https://app.datatrails.ai/archivist/v2/attachments/assets/c04d5ecf-02e0-4be2-a014-ffbbf0e8ddeb/events/de834094-f6c3-4e38-9b37-8c61dea312c9/08838336-c357-460d-902a-3aba9528dd22
```

### Retrieve Information About a Specific Attachment

Itâ€™s also possible to retrieve information about specific attachment using this API.

This information includes the `scanned_status` of the attachment. Attachment scanning happens each day.

To do so, simply issue a request as above with the suffix `/info`.

```bash
curl -v \
    -H "@$HOME/.datatrails/bearer-token.txt" \
    https://app.datatrails.ai/archivist/v2/attachments/assets/c04d5ecf-02e0-4be2-a014-ffbbf0e8ddeb/08838336-c357-460d-902a-3aba9528dd22/info
```

The response will include basic information about the attachment:

```json
{
  "hash": {
    "alg": "SHA256",
    "value": "75debbfc7a4d988f2321dfb158fe65c62dabe50d4d7b6efb961e83be43a8aa77"  },
  "identity": "attachments/08838336-c357-460d-902a-3aba9528dd22",
  "issuer": "local",
  "mime_type": "image/jpeg",
  "size": 81254,
  "subject": "user@datatrails.com",
  "tenantid": "tenant/<tenant-id>",
  "timestamp_accepted": "2023-02-06T16:04:31Z",
  "scanned_status": "NOT_SCANNED",
  "scanned_bad_reason": "",
  "scanned_timestamp": ""
}
```
